# StarGAN-Emotional-VC
A repository for my MSc project at Imperial College London.

The project is based around using neural networks to perform emotional voice conversion, which is the process of altering spoken word audio such that that the emotional tone is changed. The model architecture is heavily inspired by the StarGAN architecture, and StarGAN-VC architecture.

This project is set to be completed by 07/09/2019.
